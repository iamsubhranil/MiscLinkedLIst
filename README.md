#### A linked list with multiple type of elements
This is my take on a linked list which can contain all of three primitive type of elements, the longs, doubles and characters. This list supports all basic operations that can be performed over a linked list, insertion, deletion, and traversal. There is no bridges and bounaries, various types of nodes can be added to or deleted from any position at runtime, dynamically. Since the list is dynamic and is not size restricted, the only time when you'll be restricted to do certain operations in the list is when the list is empty, or when you don't have enough space for new nodes in your RAM.
Go try it. Have fun.
Happy Coding :)
